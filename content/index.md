## Setting Overview

**Genre**: 
Modern Fantasy / Horror / Mystery / Low Magic / Social Deception

**Tone:** 
Grim with moments of wit and absurdity

**World/Location:** 
It’s 1903. The newly expanded Hong Kong is a city of contradictions. By day, the bustling streets of Kowloon are filled with the clatter of rickshaws, ferries, and trams. You can almost forget about the dark undercurrents that run beneath the city's surface. Almost. By night, the streets grow deadly silent — except for the shadowy figures slipping in and out of alleyways. In the misty, gaslit streets, rumours whisper of monstrous creatures—vampires, werewolves, and horrors beyond human comprehension. The night belongs to the seedy underworld, where criminal empires, drug lords, and cults wrestle for power. And let’s not forget, a good number of these criminals have… peculiar habits. *You wouldn’t believe the number of vampire enthusiasts who still think it’s a fashion trend.* The air is thick with smog, and not all of it comes from the ports. It’s hard to tell where the fog ends and the monsters begin, but as investigators, your job is to uncover the truth—or at least get paid for your trouble. But don’t expect the answers to be clear, or easy. Everyone has their own secrets, and the city’s mysteries are more dangerous than you might imagine.

### Story Premise

You and your fellow _investigators_ form a rag-tag team under the banner of the newly formed **Hong Kong Imperial Investigation Bureau (HKIIB)**, an official but clandestine agency created to combat the growing threat of crime and supernatural disturbances in the colony. However, your team is anything but traditional.

Maybe you’re nobodies—just ordinary folk with a sharp mind, a knack for trouble, and a thirst for justice. Maybe you’re former criminals looking for a way out of your past, or perhaps disgruntled Imperial officers who’ve seen enough of the Empire’s corruption. Whatever your background, you’ve found yourself thrown together in the Special Response Division, the HKIIB’s more hands-on team that deals with the city’s most dangerous cases. You’re tasked with handling things that are too dark, too complicated, or too downright strange for regular law enforcement.

You’ll chase down leads, intercept heists, and confront gangsters, smugglers, and all manner of nefarious figures in the city’s underbelly. But your work doesn’t just involve conventional crime—it’s about dealing with the supernatural forces that plague Hong Kong’s nights. Rumours are swirling that the criminal syndicates are not just human; that there are vampires, werewolves, and cults running things from the shadows. No one knows how far this conspiracy stretches. But one thing is certain: it’s the job of you and your team to get to the truth—or die trying.

Your cases will come from a variety of sources: official HKIIB orders, anonymous tips from those too afraid to speak openly, and rumours from the city’s many taverns, where the truth is often half-hidden behind a drink or a whispered conversation. You’ll need to navigate a city full of lies, deception, and shifting allegiances—because everyone has something to hide. Even you.

As you work to uncover the secrets of the city, you’ll realize that the mysteries you unravel lead you to more questions. Who can you trust? Is there any such thing as a clean hand in this dirty city? And will the truth you find be more terrifying than the monsters lurking in the shadows?

### Character Creation Guidelines
* **Starting Level**: Level 1
* **Allowed Races**: Humans, Night Creatures (Consult Lorekeeper for this information)
* **Allowed Classes**: All classes, but note that magic is still very much taboo in most circles. Being caught as a mage by normal civilians could lead to trouble. This is very much a low magic setting for the most part
* **Background:** For the most part, you are a person who comes from a real country or region from earth during that time period. You may be of any nation so long as your arrival in Hong Kong can be explained. Upon discussion, you may or may not be affiliated with a faction other than the HKIID, at which point your goal is to sabotage or misdirect your party in order to advantage your faction
