To determine a character's stats we use a system known as *Serpentine Socialism* in which 3d6 are rolled a number of times equal to (6 x *Number of Players*) + *Number of Players*, and is noted down somewhere were all players can see. From here players go in a clockwise order, selecting one "High" roll, and another one that is as close to an equal magnitude close to the lowest number available as the previous is over highest (e.g. Let 17 be the highest roll on the table and 3 be the lowest. The currently available rolls may be 16, 15, 13, 5, and 7.  If the player selects 15 or 16 as their high stat in this round, 5 must be their low stat. Likewise, if they chose 13, 7 must be their low stat) Once 2 options have been selected by a player, mark those specific roles as used and continue around the table until everyone has 6 stats. Note that each player would only select 2 stats in any given round of selection.
