### Overview
To make a *Cinderveil* character (also called a player character, or investigator), grab your dice, a blank character sheet, and follow along with the wiki. *A video walkthrough will be available on youtube once I finish tweaking the rest of the system*

---
#### Name
Choose a worthy name for your investigator. If unsure, use *Behind the Name* for a useful name generator (https://www.behindthename.com/random/)

#### Ancestry
Your character's cultural and ancestral heritage

#### Class
Your character's primary occupation or skillset

#### Level
You either start at 0 or 1st level. You gain levels through earning XP

#### XP
You start with 0 experience points (XP). You gain XP based on completing investigations, uncovering information or increasing your reputation with a faction

#### Faction & Alignment
Your character's ties to the game world, gives access to ins and certain NPCs. Depending on the campaign, it could also lead to gaining experience. Each faction has a specific alignment (Ã  la D&D 5e)

#### Title
Title determines how NPCs initially perceive you, and refer to you as. As you become more notorious in your skillset, your title changes. Title is based on level, class and faction alignment. 

#### Background
Your history and past experience. You are adept at tasks related to your background.

#### Stats
The six scores that determine your physical and mental characteristics. Stats will be determined through *Serpentine Socialism* during a Session Zero or Session One

#### Talents
Your special abilities. Whether it be a boon from a god, a bargain from a night creature, research of the occult, or other means. Your class, ancestry and talent rolls grant you these. The benefits of talents can stack.

#### Spells
Although taboo to most of society, some classes may learn and cast magic spells.

#### Gear
Your equipment. You can carry a number of items that fill up a number of slots equal to 10 or your strength stat, whichever is higher.
